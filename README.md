# Site Details :computer: #




## CSS organisation :art: ##

- CSS reset is at the beginning of ```index.css```. I used Andy Bell's excellent 'Modern CSS Reset', which can be found here: https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset

- All pages have a dedicated stylesheet for desktop/large screens. Those stylesheets are then imported into ```index.css```

- Mobile styling is written directly into ```index.css```

- ```index.css``` also hass some general css rules that affect the entore page, such as the main container for the page, scroll bar, a reset on ```<a>``` tags and the ```.mob-only``` class
